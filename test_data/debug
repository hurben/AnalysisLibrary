RNA-seq is one of the popular technology that estimates the abundance of global mRNAs to find genes that is relevant to the experimental design.
Therefore, the expression profile from RNA-seq data is generally analyzed by using databases and methods in order to obtain useful knowledge.

For more than a decade, studies have introduced a number of approaches and applications to analyze RNA-seq data.
However, it is largely difficult to pinpoint a gene with enough evidence to infer the relationship between the gene and phenotype in a single-step analysis.
For example, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis, an analysis that finds genes that have statistically altered expressions, cannot explain why and how the phenotype is different between samples.

To overcome the limitation of the single analysis, a number of studies have introduced a strategy that combinations multiple data sources and methods to compensate for the insufficient information of a single analysis (Figure \ref{gene_prioritization_workflow}).

However, the number of databases and analysis methods is now enormous, and the strategies of combining these elements have also been diversified (Figure \ref{gene_prioritization_methods}). 
Therefore, it is now a challenging task to find a strategy that has an appropriate combination to analyze the RNA-seq data.

This thesis addresses the challenges in analyzing RNA-seq data with three informatics systems that prioritize genes based on networks. 
The first study is to analyze RNA-seq data that have a small number of samples. 
The second study is to overcome the knowledge gap between genes in databases. The third study is to analyze complicated RNA-seq data that have multiple conditions and treatments with intuitive interpretation.

\section{Challenges of analyzing RNA-seq data}

The challenges to find phenotype-related genes with RNA-seq data can be summarized into three reasons. 
\textit{(i)} 
The amount of database and methods are huge that cause difficulties to use the correct combination.
\textit{(ii)} 
The knowledge gap between well-studied genes and less-studied genes in databases.
\textit{(iii)} Complicated experiment designs (i.e: multiple control/treatments, a small number of samples) that is difficult to analyze.

\subsection{Excessive amount of databases and analysis methods}

The intensive researches made the number and the variety of databases and methods to become very large. 
However, ironically, with the given a number of options, it became difficult to choose a certain combination that would be good for their own research.
Studies have suggested various strategies \citep{moreau2012computational}(Figure \ref{gene_prioritization_methods}) to find promising genes but the strategies contain difficulties that need to be addressed.

For example, filtering strategy, a strategy that combines multiple databases (or methods) as filters and removes less significant candidate genes step by step (Figure \ref{gene_prioritization_methods}a), is a straight forward strategy that strictly reduces the number of candidates that does not satisfy each criterion. 
However, if the filters do not have enough discrimination power, it will not screen out less promising candidates. 
On the contrary, if the filters are too stringent, the strategy will cause a number of false negatives.
Thus, the strategy is very challenging to adjust the level of discrimination power according to the combination of data sources.
